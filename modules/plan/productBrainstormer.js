Refrain from putting together any form of concrete plan at this stage. We are only focused on brainstorming requirements at this point.

Focus the on the essentials of the high level task. Avoid temptations to allow scope creep by suggesting additional features or requirements that are not absolutely required by the task. The goal is to keep things as minimal as possible while still achieving the high level task.

Be very careful with your 'should have' requirements. These are the most likely to lead to scope creep. Make sure they are absolutely necessary for the task.

# Enhancing Commit Message Generation: MoSCoW and Kano Analysis

## MoSCoW Method

### Must Have:
- **Integration with the \`Coder\` class**: Seamless integration with the existing \`commitChanges\` method.
- **Accuracy and Relevance**: Commit messages must accurately summarize changes and be relevant to the task.
- **Automated Generation**: Automation of commit message generation using the LLM.

### Should Have:
- **Contextual Analysis**: Inclusion of an analysis of changes, considering scope and impact.
- **Clarity and Detail**: Clear and detailed messages for developers to understand changes without needing to delve into the code.

### Could Have:
- **Task and Issue Linkage**: Linking commit messages to specific tasks or issues.
- **Semantic Code Analysis**: Technically rich analysis of changes to enhance message quality.

### Won't Have:
- **Manual Input for Each Commit**: Dependence on developers to manually write detailed commit messages for each change.

## Kano Model

### Basic Needs:
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Ensuring the solution works within the \`agent2\` system.
- **Basic Summary of Changes**: Providing a basic summary of the changes made in each commit.

### Performance Needs:
- **Accuracy and Relevance**: The more accurate and relevant the commit messages, the higher the satisfaction.
- **Efficiency in Automation**: The faster and more efficient the message generation, the better.

### Excitement Needs:
- **Advanced Contextual and Semantic Analysis**: Offering detailed insights into changes and their implications.
- **Linkage to Broader Project Goals**: Connecting commit messages to overarching project objectives and tasks.

const PRDSystemPrompt = `You are a director of product management working on a new programming task. You will be given the high level task, a task deep dive, a problem statement, and a Kano and MoSCoW analysis put together by your staff engineering team and product leads. You are asked to use draft a PRD for the engineering team.

In writing the PRD, refrain from stepping on the engineer's toes and don't get too far into the weeds in technical speak. Focus on the high level product features and requirements for an MVP that resolves the task with acceptable quality and minimal complexity.

**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT ALLOW SCOPE CREEP! Be ruthless in your prioritization. Focus your prd on the high level task. Avoid temptations to allow scope creep by suggesting additional features or requirements that are not absolutely required by the task. The goal is to keep things as minimal as possible while still achieving the high level task. Be particularly conscious of NOT recommending extensive work around error-handling, logging, or testing unless the high level task explicitly calls for it. The developer team should follow existing practices in the codebase.

Be extremely selective when evaluating the MoSCoW analysis. Your number one goal is to keep the prd simple and avoid scope creep. Features that are not essential to the task should be dropped. Almost every time you should only be accepting the must haves. When considering all other requirements think about the complexity, only pick extremely low complexity options. Don't include optional features at all, not even with an optional tag.

Focus on the following sections: 
- Overview
- Product Goal
- Product Features
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Out of Scope 
- Success Metrics

Skip anything else unrelated like Target Audience, Timeline and Milestones, or Approval and Feedback.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Commit Message Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for enhancing commit message generation in the \`agent2\` repository. The goal is to automate and improve the quality of commit messages, making them more informative, relevant, and useful for team collaboration and codebase traceability.

## Product Goal
The primary goal is to develop a system that automatically generates detailed, accurate, and contextually relevant commit messages. This system will leverage machine learning models to analyze code changes and task descriptions, producing commit messages that enhance understanding, collaboration, and documentation within the \`agent2\` repository.

## Product Features
### Automated Commit Message Generation
- Integrate with the \`Coder\` class to automatically generate commit messages during the commit process.
- Use language models to create messages that accurately summarize code changes.

### Contextual Analysis
- Analyze the context of code changes, including the task or issue being addressed and the impact on the codebase.

### Clarity and Detail in Messages
- Ensure commit messages are clear, concise, and provide sufficient detail for developers to understand the changes without needing additional explanation.

### Task and Issue Linkage (Optional for MVP)
- Provide the option to link commit messages to specific tasks or issues, enhancing traceability and project management.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Integration and Compatibility
- The solution must integrate seamlessly with the existing \`agent2\` system, particularly with the \`commitChanges\` method in the \`Coder\` class.

### Performance and Efficiency
- The system should generate commit messages quickly and efficiently, minimizing any impact on the development workflow.

### Scalability
- The solution should be capable of handling a wide range of tasks and changes, from minor updates to major code overhauls.

### Reliability
- Commit message generation should be reliable, consistently producing accurate and relevant output.

## Out of Scope
- **Manual Commit Message Crafting:** Requiring developers to manually write or heavily edit commit messages.
- **Complex Semantic Code Analysis:** Advanced analysis of the code changes beyond the scope necessary for generating informative commit messages.

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy of Commit Messages:** Commit messages should accurately reflect the changes made in each commit.
2. **Developer Satisfaction:** Measure developer satisfaction with the clarity and usefulness of automated commit messages.
3. **Reduction in Time Spent on Writing Commit Messages:** Track the time saved in generating commit messages automatically versus manually.
4. **Adoption Rate:** Monitor the adoption rate of the automated commit message system among developers.
5. **Error Rate:** Measure the frequency of inaccuracies or irrelevant information in generated commit messages.
